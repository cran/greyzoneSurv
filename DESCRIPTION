Description: Allows one to classify patients into low, intermediate, and high risk groups for disease progression based on a continuous marker that is associated with progression-free survival. It uses a latent class model to link the marker and survival outcome and produces two cutoffs for the marker to divide patients into three groups. See the References section for more details.
